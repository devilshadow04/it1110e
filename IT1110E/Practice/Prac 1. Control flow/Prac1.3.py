#GrabBike's pricing in Hanoi is calculated as follow: for the first 2km, the customer will be charged
#VND 12,000 and for each next km, he will be charged VND 3,500. In addition, after the first 2km, the customer
#will be charged VND 350 for each minute travel.
#Given the distance and the average speed (assume that the speed is constant), calculate the amount of money that
#the customer has to pay
