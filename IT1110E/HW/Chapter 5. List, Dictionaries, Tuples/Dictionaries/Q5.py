#You are given a sequence of integers. A subsequence is a sequence of elements obtained by removing
#some elements (or removing nothing) from the original one. An alternating subsequence is a subsequence, whose
#values change sign, i.e. every two successive elements in the subsequence must have opposite signs.

#Your task is to find the longest alternating subsequence with elements whose absolute values are strictly
#increasing.
