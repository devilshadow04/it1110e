#In US, the president is not elected by direct vote, but by a two-level vote. First, elections are held
#in each state and the winner of the elections in that state is determined. Then state elections are held:
#in these elections, each state has a certain number of votes - the number of electors from that state.
#In practice, all state electors vote according to the results of intra-state voting, that is, states with a
#different number of votes vote in the final stage of elections. You know who each state voted for and how many
#votes were cast by that state. Summarize the results of the elections: for each of the voting participants,
#determine the number of votes cast for him.
