#In the family tree, each person, except for the ancestor, has exactly one parent. Each element of the
#tree is associated with a non-negative integer called the height. The ancestor has a height of 0, any other
#element has a height that is greater more 1 than its parent. Given a family tree, your task is to determine the
#height of all its elements.
